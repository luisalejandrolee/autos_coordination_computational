The original was made to capture output from Behaviour Space, processs the machines and then print it to use in Stata. This is too cumbersome, so decided to implement and do everything in Python so I can centralise all the analysis and work on the next algorithms such as Joint Machines, frequencies and unused behavioural states in order to analyse properly how the transitions are happening."
